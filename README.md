### Running the server locally

Make sure that your 8000 and 3306 port are clear (i.e no service on your computer is using it). Have [Docker and Docker compose](https://www.docker.com/) ready, whatever OS you're using. Clone this repository to your machine, cd into it, then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Installation may take a while depending on your internet connection. After everything is done and you see 2 containers have been set up. Open your favorite browser and visit "localhost:8000/", you should see the index page of the website.
